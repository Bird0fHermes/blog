			<h1>First post</h1>
			<p>Hello, world! This site started with the idea to make a completely static blog site / homepage. It took a little bit, but the blog is finally started.</p>
			<p>I'm Max, a third year comp sci and linguistics student at Seattle Pacific University. I'm also the Multimedia Editor for the school's newspaper <a href="https://thefalcon.online">The Falcon</a>.</p>
			<p>While my Twitter is mostly stream-of-consciousness bs, I'm hoping that this blog lends itself to longer, more thought out pieces of garbage.</p>
