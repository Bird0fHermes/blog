			<h1>Why facial recognition is dangerous</h1>
			<img style="float:right" src="resources/vhposter.jpg" alt="Vintage Hitchcock poster">
			<p>Seeing as Portland has just passed the <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90436355/portlands-proposed-facial-recognition-ban-could-be-the-strictest-yet">strictest facial recognition ban yet</a>, now is a good time to talk about why <em>any</em> use of facial recognition as surveillance is bad.<p>
			<p>Let's say that you are a "person of interest" to an authority group. If they want to find information about you, they have to employ people to follow you, listen to your phone calls, and search through your garbage. This is a time consuming and expensive process, and can be used on a relatively small number of people at any one time.</p>
			<p>Facial recognition technology takes away this time and cost burden. A machine does not need to be payed.
