                        <h1>Fall Quarter Wrap-up</h1>
                        <p>Fall quarter kicked my ass. Classes were hard and it has been an adjustment working at the Falcon.</p>
                        <p>The Falcon has been a good experience though. The editor staff that has been put together is really great. Everyone is good at their jobs and we are only getting better</p>
                        <p>The staff is great as well. We put out some really good news pieces like <a href="https://thefalcon.online/6182/news/food-insecurity-hits-close-to-home/">this one about food insecurity</a> and <a href="https://thefalcon.online/6034/opinions/no-human-being-is-illegal/">this op-ed about how we need to change our language around immigration</a>. Multimedia has put out a few videos as well, though not as many as I had hoped. That is what we will be focusing more on in the coming quarters.</p>
                        <p>Academically, I've struggled more this quarter than I have in the past. I think that it's because I have less unstructured time; it takes some forethought to get homework done when you are busy four nights a week.</p>
                        <p>Overall, I leave this quarter thoroughly exhausted, glad and looking forward to what comes ahead.</p>
