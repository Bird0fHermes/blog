			<h1>Coronavirus Travel Day</h1>
			<p>So as of Friday, the big three universities in Seattle have moved classes online for the remainder of the quarter due to concerns over the coronavirus. With nothing keeping us here physically, a lot of students are leaving on their spring break trips early, myself included.</p>
			<p>I moved up my flight home from the day of my last final to Sunday yesterday. I did just get two weeks worth of food on Thursday, but three weeks of homecooked meals should make up for that.</p>
			<p>The anecdotes are true; the airports are much less crowded, though the flight that I was on was full. A few people were wearing masks, but the atmosphere was mostly relaxed. My one complaint is that because fewer people are in the airport, TSA was much less lenient when it came to what they were letting through.</p>
