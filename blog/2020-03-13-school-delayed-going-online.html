			<h1>School Delayed, Going Online</h1>
			<p>I just got an email that Seattle Pacific will be conducting classes online only for the Spring Quarter, as well as delaying the start of school until 14 April. If you haven't heard about this, you can read about it in <a href="https://thefalcon.online/7199/news/spu-spring-quarter-classes-to-be-held-remotely/#photo">The Falcon</a>.</p>
			<p>Things are moving very quickly and it is getting difficult to make long term plans. Hopefully I'll be able to get back to Seattle at the end of March, if only to recover my ThinkPad, but also because I think that The Falcon works best when we are able to meet in the same place.</p>
			<p>As things stand right now, I don't think that things will change too much for campus life. Most homework is turned in online and actual class time is a relatively small amount of the time you spend at school. My CS professors have transitioned well to using Microsoft Teams for class, but my other professors have yet to get the hang of using Zoom. Guess we'll see if they have the hang of it by the time class starts again.</p>
