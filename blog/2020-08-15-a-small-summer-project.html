			<h1>A Small Summer Project</h1>
			<p>I've put together a little program that I use to
			manage my to-do list. It was originally a
			<a href="resources/todo.sh">bash script</a>, which
			I wrote back in May. The script allows me to add tomorrow's
			date and a task to the text file that keeps track of the
			list, as well as print the most recent entries in the
			list.</p>
			<p>I've found myself with some free time and the desire
			to make something small, so I've ported my little bash
			script to C. Functionality is mostly duplicated, though
			the C program adds the ability to add items to the list
			without opening a text editor. Writing this also gave me
			the opportunity to mess around with makefiles and
			PKGBUILDS, both of which I've found to be less daunting
			than they seem.</p>
			<p>I've put the project up on
			<a href="https://github.com/maxrbriggs/todo">Github</a>
			and have also created a
			<a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/todo-git/">
				PKGBUILD</a> for Arch Linux. You can also
			<a href="resources/todo-master.zip">download the utility
				here.
			</a> Both the bash script and the C utility are licensed
			under the GNU General Public License Version 3.</p>
